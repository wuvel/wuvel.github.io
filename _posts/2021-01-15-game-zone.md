Learn to hack into this machine. Understand how to use SQLMap, crack some passwords, reveal services using a reverse SSH tunnel and escalate your privileges to root!

## Deploy the vulnerable machine.
- Scanning.

## Exposing services with reverse SSH tunnels
Reverse SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.

`-L` is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. `-R` is a remote tunnel (YOU --> CLIENT). You forward your traffic to the other server for others to view. Similar to the example above, but in reverse.

Checking if any sockets running on the machine:

    ```bash
    agent47@gamezone:~$ ss -tulpn
    Netid  State      Recv-Q Send-Q       Local Address:Port                      Peer Address:Port

We can see that a service running on port 10000 is blocked via a firewall rule from the outside (we can see this from the IPtable list). However, Using an SSH Tunnel we can expose the port to us (locally)!

From our local machine, run `ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 <username>@<ip>`.

```bash
$ ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.2.113

Once complete, in your browser type "localhost:10000" and you can access the newly-exposed webserver.
